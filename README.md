When I was 5 I upgraded the living room of our home into my own gallery by taking all my pencil crayons and making huge murals on the walls. To my parents it was scribbles, but I call it abstract. Even though my parents weren't pleased with it didn't stop me from doing what I enjoyed, which was art!

I love exploring thats why I chose graphic design. It's such a broad platform! I'm the happiest when i'm working on branding, packaging, motion, and illustration.

To me being a graphic designer means finding creative ways to visually interact information with people. Three things I live by are Build, create, and explore. If you're not learning new things and stepping out of your comfort zone you're not growing!
