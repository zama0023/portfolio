        <p class="push-0">My client wanted to incorporate the name "Subhan Sound". To combine it with the identity of their brand, "Dope sound, and Being Yourself". To create a logo that would represent a mix of culture, passion, and music in one image.</p>

        <p class="push-0">Below you will see my concept exploration. Starting with rough sketches I then moved on to digital renders. Trying different fonts and colours to find the best match, these were the top six that were presented to the client.</p>
