    <p class="text-upper bold push-0">A short story of where it all began</p>
    <p>When I was 3 I upgraded the living room of our home into my own gallery by taking all my pencil crayons and making huge murals on the walls. To my parents it was a mess, but I call it abstract. Even though my parents weren't pleased it didn't stop me from doing what I enjoyed, which was art!</p>
    <p class="text-upper bold push-0 pad-b">Now thats settled...<br>lets move on to why I do what I do</p>
    <p>I love exploring, that's why I chose graphic design. I simply enjoy finding new creative ways to communicate designs.</p>
    <p>To me being a designer means I get to Build, Create, and Explore. If you're not learning new things and stepping out of your comfort zone you're not growing!</p>
    <h4 class="text-upper italic bold push-0 milli">i hope you enjoyed the website i coded! </h4>
